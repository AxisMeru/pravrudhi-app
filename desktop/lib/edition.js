// Which of the two products this install is. Studio builds and improves Pravrudhi; Pravrudhi improves whatever
// its user is building. They are one codebase and two installs that must sit side by side on one machine, so
// the answer is decided when the build is made: a packaged app has no role to read and no repository to consult.
//
// It arrives as `edition.json` beside the packaged resources, copied there by whichever electron-builder
// configuration made the build (`extraResources`). Running from source there is no such file, and the answer is
// the product.
//
// Two simpler-looking approaches were tried and are recorded because both fail quietly:
//
//   `extraMetadata` writes the edition into the packaged package.json — and, with the app directory equal to
//   the project directory, writes the transformed file back over the *source*. One build left this repository
//   with a seven-line package.json, no scripts and no devDependencies.
//
//   `app.getName()` looked like it would return the productName. It does not: electron-builder leaves `name` as
//   `pravrudhi-desktop` in the packaged package.json and carries productName elsewhere, so both builds answered
//   identically and Studio would have run as the product with nothing to show for it.
//
// Anything unreadable, missing or unrecognised is the product. Studio is the operator's edition and is not
// released to any other user, so a build that cannot say what it is must be the harmless one; defaulting the
// other way would ship Studio to whoever downloaded an unlabelled build.

/**
 * The BYOK provider-key surface on /settings. Before this test existed, the frontend's `ProviderKeyResult` type
 * declared `{ok, reason}` -- a shape the engine never sent. `set_provider_key` (AxisMeru/pravrudhi's
 * src/pravrudhi/api/server.py) returns `{provider, configured: true, validated: bool, reason: str}`, so
 * `result.ok` was always `undefined`, and EVERY successful key save rendered as a failure -- with the probe's
 * own success marker (`reason: "ok"`) shown as the literal error text. `delete_provider_key` never had a
 * `reason` field at all, so every successful removal showed "remove failed".
 *
 * "openai-compatible" (credentials.py's PROVIDERS) has an empty `base_url` and the frontend has no field to
 * supply one, so validation for it deterministically fails with a real, specific reason ("no base_url
 * configured for this provider; pass one explicitly") -- no network call, no external credential, and no
 * mocking: a real request against the real running engine's real validation logic.
 *
 * Run against a live engine that serves this repository's built interface:
 *   PRAVRUDHI_EDITION=product PRAVRUDHI_FRONTEND_DIR=$PWD/frontend/out pravrudhi app --root <workspace> --port 8301
 *   LOCAL_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8301 npx playwright test settings-byok.spec.ts

 * Mirrors AxisMeru/pravrudhi's app/frontend/e2e/edition-signin-guards.spec.ts. Two of the 2026-09-12 defects
 * were exactly the shape a heading-and-status-code check cannot see: the sign-in buttons rendered with no
 * visible text (a Tailwind theme token neither light nor dark mode ever defined, so the button's own text
 * colour matched its own background), and a page whose auth-gated fetch failed showed a "Could not reach the
 * engine's X API" paragraph instead of the sign-in redirect the engine actually intended. `src/app/signin/page.tsx`
 * is byte-identical to Studio's copy, so the same button names and the same check apply unchanged.

// The streaming half of the chat surface: parses `POST /api/chat/stream`'s server-sent events as they arrive so
// a long tool-calling turn shows real progress - "reading the ledger", then its result - instead of a blank
// wait ending in one lump reply. `streamChat` always resolves with the same `ChatResponse` shape `chat()` does,
// because whatever happens mid-stream, the caller ends up holding one finished turn either way.
//
// A turn that fails partway - the endpoint drops, a chunk cannot be parsed, the connection never opens - falls
// back to the existing blocking route with the same message and thread id. The backend defers persisting the
// user's turn until it has an answer for it (see `application/chat.py`'s `_finish_turn`), so a stream that dies
// before its `done` event leaves nothing in the thread for this fallback call to duplicate.
